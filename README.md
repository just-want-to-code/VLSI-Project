# Welcome to our VLSI Project!!

This project is about developing a congestion-aware routing algorithm for 3D NoCs that minimizes latency, enhances throughput, and improves load distribution across the network. We have explored an adaptive XYZ algorithm that improves the vanilla XYZ algorithm.
## Files

[xyzdesign.txt](https://github.com/just-want-to-code/VLSI-Project/blob/main/xyzdesign.txt)- This file consists of the design code for the router using XYZ algorithm. \
[xyztest.txt](https://github.com/just-want-to-code/VLSI-Project/blob/main/xyzdesign.txt)- This file consists of the testbench code for simulating the XYZ algorithm. \
[axyzdesign.txt](https://github.com/just-want-to-code/VLSI-Project/blob/main/axyzdesign.txt)- This file consists of the design code for the router using adaptive XYZ algorithm. \
[axyztest.txt](https://github.com/just-want-to-code/VLSI-Project/blob/main/axyztest.txt)- This file consists of the testbench code for simulating the adaptive XYZ algorithm. \
[sample_result.txt](https://github.com/just-want-to-code/VLSI-Project/blob/main/sample_result.txt)- This file consists of a comparison between XYZ and adaptive XYZ algorithm using a single test case. 

## Steps

Run the design and test code for each algorithm in any verilog complier like [edaplayground](https://edaplayground.com/).

## Comparison

Here are some graphs to showcase the difference in the two algorithms in a congestion- simulated 3d mesh.
